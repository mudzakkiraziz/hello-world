# hello-world
first repository to test uploading projects into github
Testing out features of github before uploading projects done on kaggle/other notebooks into github.

Hi, my name is Mudzakkir Aziz, a 2nd Year Student studying at the Singapore University of Technology and Design. I am interested in data analytics and data science, and am looking to dive deeper into the industry when I graduate. At the same time, I am currently trying to self-learn as much as possible through online tutorials and via trying my hand at projects on websites such as kaggle.
